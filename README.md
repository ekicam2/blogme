# blogme
Simple CMS written in PHP protected from SQL injections in the most common way (i think). 
I do not recommend to use it as your blog-engine, it has no bugs (at least i do not know about any).
This code were written only for kill my free time. So if you want to change/develop it go on. 
After a few days being face to face with PHP I don't thnik so I will back to that monster!

#Have fun and code!
